**Overall Risk Score**: 1 (LOW RISK)

## Risk Assessment Details

### 1. Code Quality Risk
- **Probability**: Low (1) - Code follows established patterns and best practices
- **Impact**: Low (1) - Minor refactoring opportunities only
- **Mitigation**: Code already follows TypeScript and React best practices
- **Status**: âœ… Mitigated

### 2. Test Coverage Risk
- **Probability**: Low (1) - Comprehensive test suite already implemented
- **Impact**: Low (1) - All functionality covered with 119/119 tests passing
- **Mitigation**: Full test coverage for all acceptance criteria
- **Status**: âœ… Mitigated

### 3. Security Risk
- **Probability**: Low (1) - Components only display data, no user input execution
- **Impact**: Low (1) - No security vulnerabilities identified
- **Mitigation**: Proper data sanitization and safe rendering
- **Status**: âœ… Mitigated

### 4. Performance Risk
- **Probability**: Low (1) - Components use efficient React patterns
- **Impact**: Low (1) - Optimized state management and rendering
- **Mitigation**: Proper React hooks usage and efficient re-rendering
- **Status**: âœ… Mitigated

### 5. Maintainability Risk
- **Probability**: Low (1) - Clean, well-structured code with proper interfaces
- **Impact**: Low (1) - Easy to understand and modify
- **Mitigation**: Consistent patterns and comprehensive documentation
- **Status**: âœ… Mitigated

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Already Implemented
