# Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for repoHack's MVP while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements. The monolithic Next.js approach with server actions ensures simplicity and rapid development, while the modular scanner architecture allows for easy addition of new threat detection capabilities.

The system is designed to meet the 15-second scan requirement while maintaining security and reliability. The stateless architecture ensures scalability on Next.js backend platforms, and the comprehensive error handling provides a robust user experience.

Key architectural decisions prioritize:
1. **Simplicity**: Single codebase with clear separation of concerns
2. **Performance**: Optimized scanning pipeline with parallel execution
3. **Security**: Isolated scanning environment with no code execution
4. **Maintainability**: Modular scanner architecture for easy extension
5. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
