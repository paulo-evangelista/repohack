# Next Steps

**UX Expert Prompt:**
Create a minimalist, dark-themed user interface for repoHack using Tailwind CSS and Fira Mono font. Focus on a clean, developer-friendly design with blue accents. The interface should have a simple repository URL input form and an adaptive results display that dynamically renders JSON scan results without hardcoded sections. Prioritize clarity and ease of use for developers scanning repositories for security threats.

**Architect Prompt:**
Design the technical architecture for repoHack, a Next.js 14+ application with app directory structure. The system needs to clone Git repositories, perform multi-step security scanning using server actions, and return structured JSON results. Use "use server" directive for the main scan function, with individual threat detection functions running in the server context. Focus on a monolithic Next.js architecture deployable on Vercel, with no database requirements and stateless operation. Ensure the scanning process completes within 15 seconds and can handle repositories up to 100MB.
