**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure**
Establish the Next.js project setup, basic project structure, and core scanning infrastructure while delivering a functional health-check route and basic repository cloning capability.

**Epic 2: Basic Threat Detection (Arbitrary Code Execution)**
Implement the first threat scanning capability focusing on arbitrary code execution patterns (eval, Function, setTimeout with code strings), creating a working security analysis foundation.

**Epic 3: User Interface & Experience**
Build the complete web interface with the minimalist dark theme design, including the scan input form and adaptive results display that dynamically renders the JSON structure.

**Epic 4: Advanced Threat Detection (Process Spawning)**
Add detection for process spawning attempts (child_process, exec, spawn calls) to expand security coverage.

**Epic 5: Dependency & Network Analysis**
Implement suspicious dependency detection and network call analysis for comprehensive threat coverage.

**Epic 6: File System & Environment Security**
Add file system access monitoring and environment variable access detection to complete the security scanning capabilities.
