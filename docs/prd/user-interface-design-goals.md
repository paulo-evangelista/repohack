# User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision:**
A minimalist, security-focused interface with a dark theme that prioritizes clarity and trust. The design should feel like a developer tool with clean, monospace typography and subtle blue accents. No branding elements - just pure functionality.

**Key Interaction Paradigms:**
- **Single-Input Focus**: One prominent input field for repository URLs
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show high-level results first, then allow drilling down into details
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Safety status should be immediately obvious
- **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Users should understand results at a glance

**Core Screens and Views:**
- **Home/Scan Input Page**: Clean landing page with prominent URL input and clear value proposition
- **Scan Results Page**: Comprehensive security report with clear safety rating and detailed breakdown
- **Loading/Processing State**: Simple progress indication during repository analysis

**Accessibility: None**
- MVP focus on core functionality
- Accessibility features can be added in future versions

**Branding:**
- **No Branding**: Pure functional design without logos or brand elements
- **Developer Tool Aesthetic**: Clean, code-editor inspired design language
- **Minimalist Approach**: Focus on content and functionality over visual design

**Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**
- Primary focus on desktop/laptop usage (where developers typically work)
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go repository checking
- Optimized for standard web browsers across all major platforms

**Design Specifications:**
- **Theme**: Dark theme only
- **Typography**: Fira Mono monospace font
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Accent Color**: Blue accents for interactive elements and status indicators
- **Layout**: Minimal, clean design with plenty of whitespace
- **Visual Elements**: Simple, functional design without decorative elements
