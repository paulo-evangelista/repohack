# Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Protect developers from recruiter scam repositories by providing instant security scanning
- Establish repoHack as a trusted, open-source security tool in the developer community
- Reduce successful attacks through malicious repository execution
- Build an open-source community around repository security awareness
- Deliver a simple, effective web interface for repository safety assessment

**Background Context:**
repoHack addresses a critical security gap in the developer ecosystem where recruiters are exploiting the trust-based hiring process by sending malicious TypeScript repositories to job candidates. These repositories contain code designed to steal sensitive information, particularly cryptocurrency keys, from developers' computers. The current landscape lacks specialized tools for repository safety assessment, leaving developers vulnerable to sophisticated social engineering attacks. repoHack fills this void by providing an accessible, web-based security scanning service that allows developers to quickly verify repository safety before running potentially malicious code.
