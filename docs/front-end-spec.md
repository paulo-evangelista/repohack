    A --> C[Loading Indicator]
    A --> D[Scan Results Display]
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> B
```

**Navigation Structure:**
- **Primary Navigation:** Single-page application with no navigation elements
- **Secondary Navigation:** None - all content appears below the input field
- **Breadcrumb Strategy:** No breadcrumbs - single page flow

## User Flows

**Primary User Flow: Repository Security Scan**

**User Goal:** Quickly assess repository safety before running potentially malicious code

**Entry Points:** 
- Direct URL access to the homepage
- Repository URL shared via link

**Success Criteria:** 
- User receives clear safety assessment within 15 seconds
- User understands whether repository is safe to run
- User can access detailed threat information if needed

**Flow Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User arrives at homepage] --> B[User sees prominent URL input field]
    B --> C[User pastes repository URL]
    C --> D[User clicks scan button]
    D --> E[Loading indicator appears below input]
    E --> F[Scan completes within 15 seconds]
    F --> G[Results display below input]
    G --> H[User sees overall safety status]
    H --> I[User can expand threat details]
    I --> J[User makes decision about repository safety]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Invalid repository URL format
- Private repository access denied
- Network timeout during scanning
- Repository too large for scanning
- Scan failure or error

**Notes:** This flow emphasizes the single-page experience with all content appearing below the input field. The loading state provides immediate feedback, and results appear in the same view for seamless user experience.

## Wireframes & Mockups

**Primary Design Files:** 
Based on the PRD requirements, I recommend using **Figma** for creating the detailed visual designs, as it provides excellent collaboration features and design system capabilities for the component library.

**Key Screen Layouts:**

**Screen: Single Page Interface**
- **Purpose:** Complete repository scanning experience in one view
- **Key Elements:**
  - Large, centered repository URL input field
  - Prominent scan button below input
  - Loading indicator that appears below input during scan
  - Results display that replaces loading indicator when complete
  - Overall safety status prominently displayed at top of results
  - Expandable threat details below safety status
- **Interaction Notes:** All content appears below the input field, creating a natural vertical flow. Loading state provides immediate feedback, and results maintain the same positioning for seamless experience.
- **Design File Reference:** Main Figma file with component library and responsive layouts

## Component Library / Design System

**Design System Approach:** 
Based on the PRD requirements for a minimalist, developer-focused interface, I recommend creating a **custom design system** specifically for repoHack rather than using an existing one. This allows us to maintain the unique security tool aesthetic while ensuring consistency across all components.

**Core Components:**

**Component: Repository URL Input**
- **Purpose:** Primary user interaction point for entering repository URLs
- **Variants:** Default state, focus state, error state, loading state
- **States:** Empty, filled, invalid, submitting
- **Usage Guidelines:** Large, prominent placement with clear validation feedback

**Component: Scan Button**
- **Purpose:** Triggers the security scanning process
- **Variants:** Default, hover, active, disabled
- **States:** Ready, loading, completed, error
- **Usage Guidelines:** High contrast button that clearly indicates action

**Component: Loading Indicator**
- **Purpose:** Shows scan progress and maintains user engagement
- **Variants:** Initial loading, progress indication, completion
- **States:** Starting, scanning, processing, finishing
- **Usage Guidelines:** Simple, non-intrusive animation that appears below input

**Component: Safety Status Display**
- **Purpose:** Immediately communicates repository safety level
- **Variants:** Safe (green), Warning (yellow), Unsafe (red)
- **States:** Loading, safe, warning, unsafe, error
- **Usage Guidelines:** Large, prominent display with clear color coding

**Component: Threat Detail Accordion**
- **Purpose:** Allows users to drill down into specific security findings
- **Variants:** Collapsed, expanded, with threat count badges
- **States:** Closed, open, loading details
- **Usage Guidelines:** Progressive disclosure pattern for detailed information

## Branding & Style Guide

**Visual Identity:**
**Brand Guidelines:** Based on the PRD requirement for "No Branding - Pure functional design without logos or brand elements," repoHack will use a **minimalist, developer-tool aesthetic** that prioritizes functionality over visual branding.

**Color Palette:**
| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Primary | #3B82F6 (Blue-500) | Interactive elements, status indicators, focus states |
| Secondary | #1E40AF (Blue-700) | Hover states, secondary actions |
| Accent | #60A5FA (Blue-400) | Subtle highlights, progress indicators |
| Success | #10B981 (Emerald-500) | Safe repository status, positive feedback |
| Warning | #F59E0B (Amber-500) | Warning status, caution indicators |
| Error | #EF4444 (Red-500) | Unsafe repository status, error messages |
| Neutral | #1F2937 to #F9FAFB | Text, borders, backgrounds (gray scale) |

**Typography:**
- **Primary:** Fira Mono (monospace) - Main interface text, code elements
- **Secondary:** Inter (sans-serif) - Headings, labels, UI text
- **Monospace:** Fira Mono - Code snippets, technical information

**Type Scale:**
| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| H1 | 2.25rem (36px) | 700 | 1.2 |
| H2 | 1.875rem (30px) | 600 | 1.3 |
| H3 | 1.5rem (24px) | 600 | 1.4 |
| Body | 1rem (16px) | 400 | 1.6 |
| Small | 0.875rem (14px) | 400 | 1.5 |

**Iconography:**
**Icon Library:** Lucide React (open-source, consistent with minimalist aesthetic)
**Usage Guidelines:** Simple, functional icons with consistent stroke width. Use sparingly to maintain clean interface.

**Spacing & Layout:**
**Grid System:** 8px base unit system using Tailwind CSS spacing scale
**Spacing Scale:** 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px for consistent component spacing

## Accessibility Requirements

**Note:** Accessibility requirements are skipped for MVP as per project requirements. Focus is on core functionality and user experience.

## Responsiveness Strategy

**Breakpoints:**
| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones, small tablets |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets, small laptops |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Laptops, desktop monitors |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large monitors, high-res displays |

**Adaptation Patterns:**
**Layout Changes:** Single column layout on mobile, centered content with appropriate margins. Input field and button stack vertically on small screens.
**Navigation Changes:** No navigation changes needed for single-page design
**Content Priority:** Safety status remains prominent, threat details stack vertically on mobile
**Interaction Changes:** Touch-friendly button sizes on mobile, appropriate input field sizing for different devices

## Animation & Micro-interactions

**Motion Principles:**
**Tailwind-First Animation** - Leverage Tailwind CSS built-in animation utilities and extend with custom animations where needed. All animations serve functional purposes while maintaining the security tool's professional aesthetic.

**Key Animations:**

- **Loading State Transition:** `animate-fade-in` with `transition-all duration-300 ease-out` (Tailwind utilities)
- **Results Appearance:** `animate-slide-down` with `transition-all duration-400 ease-out` (Custom Tailwind extension)
- **Status Color Transitions:** `transition-colors duration-200 ease-in-out` (Native Tailwind)
- **Accordion Expansion:** `transition-all duration-250 ease-out` with height animation (Tailwind + custom)
- **Button State Changes:** `hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-150 ease-out` (Native Tailwind)

**Tailwind Extension Approach:**
Create custom animations in `tailwind.config.js` for repoHack-specific transitions:
```javascript
// Custom animations for security tool interactions
extend: {
  animation: {
    'fade-in': 'fadeIn 0.3s ease-out',
    'slide-down': 'slideDown 0.4s ease-out',
    'status-pulse': 'statusPulse 2s ease-in-out infinite'
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

**Performance Goals:**
- **Page Load:** Initial page load under 2 seconds for optimal user experience
- **Interaction Response:** Button clicks and form interactions respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Smooth 60fps animations for professional feel

**Design Strategies:**
**Optimized Asset Loading** - Minimal external dependencies, optimized Tailwind CSS output, and efficient icon loading using Lucide React's tree-shaking capabilities.
