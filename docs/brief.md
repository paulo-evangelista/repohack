# Project Brief: repoHack

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept**: repoHack is an open-source security tool that scans GitHub repositories for malicious code and potential security threats, specifically designed to protect developers from recruiter scams.

**Primary Problem**: Recruiters are sending malicious TypeScript repositories to job candidates that contain code designed to steal sensitive information (particularly cryptocurrency keys) from developers' computers.

**Target Market**: Developers, software engineers, and job seekers who receive repository links from recruiters and need to verify the safety of code before running it locally.

**Key Value Proposition**: repoHack provides a free, open-source security scanning service that allows developers to quickly analyze repository safety before cloning or running potentially malicious code, protecting them from data theft and security breaches.

## Problem Statement

**Current State and Pain Points:**
- Recruiters are exploiting the trust-based nature of the hiring process
- Malicious repositories contain code designed to steal sensitive developer information
- Primary targets include cryptocurrency keys, API tokens, and other credentials
- Developers lack tools to quickly assess repository safety before running code
- Existing security tools are either too complex or not designed for this specific threat vector

**Impact of the Problem:**
- Financial losses through stolen cryptocurrency
- Compromised developer accounts and API access
- Loss of trust in the recruitment process
- Potential for widespread developer community harm

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Traditional antivirus doesn't detect malicious code patterns
- Static analysis tools require technical expertise
- No specialized tools for repository safety assessment
- Manual code review is time-consuming and error-prone

**Urgency and Importance:**
- This scam is actively ongoing and targeting developers
- Cryptocurrency theft can result in significant financial losses
- The developer community needs immediate protection
- Open-source approach ensures accessibility and community trust

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept and Approach:**
repoHack will be a full-stack Next.js web service that provides instant repository security scanning. Users simply paste a GitHub repository URL, and the system automatically analyzes the code for security threats.

**Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions:**
- **Simplicity**: One-click scanning with clear, actionable results
- **Specialized Focus**: Built specifically for detecting recruiter scam patterns
- **Accessibility**: Web-based service requiring no technical setup
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development and transparency

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
- Addresses a specific, urgent need in the developer community
- Simple user experience removes barriers to adoption
- Open-source approach builds trust and community support
- Focused threat detection rather than generic security scanning

**High-Level Vision:**
A clean, intuitive web interface where developers can quickly verify repository safety before running code, with comprehensive threat detection and clear, actionable security reports.

**Scanning Methodology:**
1. **Static Code Analysis**: Parse TypeScript/JavaScript files for dangerous patterns
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Check npm packages for suspicious characteristics
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Detect common malicious code signatures
4. **Repository Metadata Analysis**: Examine commit history, contributors, and timing

**Threat Detection Categories:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: `eval()`, `Function()`, `setTimeout()` with code strings
- **Process Spawning**: `child_process`, `exec`, `spawn` calls
- **Suspicious Dependencies**: Recently published packages, unusual download patterns
- **File System Access**: Unauthorized file reading/writing operations
- **Network Calls**: Unexpected HTTP requests or data exfiltration
- **Environment Variable Access**: Attempts to read sensitive configuration
- **Shell Commands**: Direct system command execution

**User Experience Flow:**
1. User pastes GitHub repository URL
2. System clones and analyzes the repository
3. Comprehensive security scan runs in background
4. Results page displays:
   - Overall safety rating (Safe/Unsafe/Warning)
   - Summary of detected threats
   - Detailed breakdown by category
   - Recommendations and next steps

- **False Positive Rate**: Percentage of safe repositories flagged as threats
- **User Adoption**: Unique users per month
- **Community Engagement**: GitHub stars, forks, and contributions
- **Response Time**: Average time from URL submission to scan completion

## MVP Scope

**Core Features (Must Have):**

## Technical Considerations

**Platform Requirements:**
- **Target Platforms**: Web browsers (all major browsers)
- **Browser/OS Support**: Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Performance Requirements**: Repository scans must complete within 15 seconds

**Technology Preferences:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with app directory structure
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with "use server" actions for scanning
- **Database**: No database - stateless serverless architecture
- **Hosting/Infrastructure**: Serverless deployment (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

**Architecture Considerations:**
- **Repository Structure**: Monorepo within Next.js project
- **Service Architecture**: Monolithic Next.js application with server actions
- **Integration Requirements**: Direct Git operations from server-side code
- **Security/Compliance**: Isolated scanning environment within serverless function

**Scanning Architecture:**
- **Multi-Step Process**: Each threat type scanned independently
- **Sequential Execution**: Threat scans run in sequence for simplicity
- **Result Aggregation**: Individual scan results combined into final JSON response
- **No State Persistence**: Each scan is independent, no data stored between requests

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Constraints:**
- **Budget**: Open-source project with no budget constraints
- **Timeline**: Flexible timeline for development
- **Resources**: Single developer or small team contribution
- **Technical**: Serverless function timeout limits (typically 10-30 seconds)

**Key Assumptions:**
- Git operations can be performed within serverless function timeouts
- Repository scanning can be completed within 15 seconds for most repositories
- No persistent storage is required for MVP functionality
- Users will provide valid .git URLs
- Threat detection patterns can be implemented without external security services

## Risks & Open Questions

**Key Risks:**
- **Serverless Timeout**: Large repositories may exceed function timeout limits
- **False Positives**: Overly aggressive threat detection could reduce tool credibility
- **Repository Access**: Some repositories may be private or require authentication
- **Performance**: Complex repositories may not scan within 15-second target
- **Security**: Running potentially malicious code in scanning environment

**Open Questions:**
- How to handle very large repositories that exceed scan time limits?
- What's the best approach for isolated code execution during scanning?
- How to balance thorough scanning with performance requirements?
- Should we implement rate limiting to prevent abuse?
- How to handle repositories with complex dependency trees?

**Areas Needing Further Research:**
- Serverless function timeout optimization techniques
- Code isolation strategies for security scanning
- Performance benchmarking for different repository sizes
- Threat detection algorithm efficiency

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Create PRD**: Use this Project Brief to generate a detailed Product Requirements Document
2. **Technical Research**: Investigate serverless function optimization and code isolation strategies
3. **Threat Detection Planning**: Define specific scanning algorithms for each threat category
4. **UI/UX Design**: Create wireframes for the simple, effective user interface

**PM Handoff:**
This Project Brief provides the full context for repoHack. The next step is to create a comprehensive PRD that will guide the development process, breaking down the requirements into actionable epics and user stories.
