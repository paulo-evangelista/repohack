## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: 
  - File system traversal utilities are implemented in `lib/utils/file-utils.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#lib-directory]
  - File system scanner is created in `lib/scanners/file-system.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#scanners-directory]
  - Repository cloning functionality is working with simple-git integration
  - Unit tests are using Vitest framework with 80% coverage target [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach-tooling]
  - Project structure includes `lib/utils/` and `lib/scanners/` directories

- **Technical Stack Requirements**:
  - Use @typescript-eslint/parser for AST generation as specified in technical stack [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#backend-technologies]
  - TypeScript for type safety throughout implementation
  - Integrate with existing file system infrastructure from Story 1.3
  - Node.js runtime environment for server-side parsing operations

- **Data Models and Types**:
  - RepositoryFile interface needs to be defined with content and metadata [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanner-interface]
  - ThreatResult interface already defined with category, subcategory, severity, description, file, line, code, and details fields [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanner-interface]
  - AST node types need to be defined for function calls, variable declarations, and expressions
  - Scanner interface requires name, category, subcategory, and scan method [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanner-interface]

- **API Specifications**:
  - AST parser function signature: `parseAST(content: string, filePath: string): Promise<ASTNode[]>`
  - Code execution scanner function: `scanCodeExecution(files: RepositoryFile[]): Promise<ThreatResult[]>` [Source: architecture/server-actions-architecture.md#individual-scanner-functions]
  - Scanner must return ThreatResult[] with proper categorization under code_execution category [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanning-categories]

- **Component Specifications**:
  - AST parser utility: `lib/utils/ast-parser.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#lib-directory]
  - Code execution scanner: `lib/scanners/code-execution.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#scanners-directory]
  - Type definitions: `lib/types/index.ts` for AST-related types [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#types-directory]
  - Integration with main scan function: `lib/actions/scan.ts` [Source: architecture/server-actions-architecture.md#main-scan-function]

- **File Locations and Structure**:
  - Main AST parser utilities: `lib/utils/ast-parser.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#lib-directory]
  - Code execution scanner: `lib/scanners/code-execution.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#scanners-directory]
  - Type definitions: `lib/types/index.ts` for AST and RepositoryFile types [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#types-directory]
  - Integration with scan action: `lib/actions/scan.ts` [Source: architecture/server-actions-architecture.md#main-scan-function]

- **Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit tests should be placed in `tests/unit/utils/ast-parser.test.ts` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-structure]
  - Use Vitest framework with 80% coverage target for lib files [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach-tooling]
  - Mock filesystem calls for isolated testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-data-mocks]
  - Test AST parsing, node identification, and error handling [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-test-plan]
  - Test scanner integration and threat detection capabilities

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - Must handle TypeScript and JavaScript files without errors
  - Performance impact should be minimal and within scanning time constraints [Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md#scanning-performance-targets]
  - Memory usage should be optimized for large files
  - Parse errors must be gracefully handled without stopping the entire scan

- **Security Considerations**:
  - AST parsing should be safe and not execute any code
  - Input validation for file content before parsing
  - Memory limits to prevent DoS attacks through large files
  - Secure error handling without exposing internal parsing details

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Implement streaming parsing for large files to prevent memory issues
  - Use efficient AST traversal algorithms for pattern matching
  - Add configurable file size limits and parsing strategies
  - Monitor memory usage during AST parsing operations
  - Cache parsed ASTs for repeated analysis when possible

## Testing

### Security Review

**No security concerns found** - AST parsing is implemented safely without code execution. Input validation prevents malicious content, and the parser operates in a controlled environment. The threat detection scanner correctly identifies dangerous patterns like `eval()`, `Function()`, and shell execution calls.

### Performance Considerations

**Well-optimized implementation** - The AST parser uses efficient traversal algorithms and includes memory management considerations for large files. Performance monitoring and file size-based strategies are implemented as specified in the requirements.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review - all implementation was already complete and of high quality.
