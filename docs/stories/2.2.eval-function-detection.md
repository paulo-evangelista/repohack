# Story 2.2: Eval Function Detection

## Status
Done ✅

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the system to detect eval() function usage,
**so that** I can identify potential arbitrary code execution threats.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System scans AST for eval() function calls
2. Detects both direct eval() calls and variable-based eval calls
3. Captures file location, line number, and surrounding code context
4. Identifies eval() calls with dynamic content (variables, user input)
5. Results are formatted according to the established JSON structure
6. Threat severity is properly categorized (CRITICAL for eval usage)
7. System can handle different eval() usage patterns and edge cases

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: 
  - AST-based code parsing functionality is already implemented in `lib/utils/ast-parser.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#utils-directory]
  - Code execution scanner framework exists in `lib/scanners/code-execution.ts` with basic structure [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#scanners-directory]
  - File system traversal and repository cloning infrastructure is working from previous stories
  - Unit tests are using Vitest framework with 80% coverage target [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach-tooling]

- **Technical Stack Requirements**:
  - Use @typescript-eslint/parser for AST generation as specified in technical stack [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#backend-technologies]
  - TypeScript for type safety throughout implementation
  - Integrate with existing code execution scanner infrastructure
  - Node.js runtime environment for server-side scanning operations

- **Data Models and Types**:
  - RepositoryFile interface already defined with path, content, size, extension, lastModified, and isBinary fields [Source: lib/types/index.ts]
  - ASTNode interface includes type, loc (with line/column), range, and additional properties [Source: lib/types/index.ts]
  - ThreatResult interface requires category, subcategory, severity, description, file, line, code, and details fields [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanner-interface]
  - Scanner interface requires name, category, subcategory, and scan method [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanner-interface]

- **API Specifications**:
  - Code execution scanner must implement ThreatScanner interface with scan method [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanner-interface]
  - Function signature: `scan(files: RepositoryFile[]): Promise<ThreatResult[]>`
  - Scanner must return ThreatResult[] with proper categorization under code_execution category [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanning-categories]
  - Eval() threats should be categorized as 'code_execution' with appropriate subcategory

- **Component Specifications**:
  - Code execution scanner: `lib/scanners/code-execution.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#scanners-directory]
  - AST parser utilities: `lib/utils/ast-parser.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#utils-directory]
  - Type definitions: `lib/types/index.ts` for AST and RepositoryFile types [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#types-directory]
  - Integration with main scan function: `lib/actions/scan.ts` [Source: architecture/server-actions-architecture.md#main-scan-function]

- **File Locations and Structure**:
  - Main code execution scanner: `lib/scanners/code-execution.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#scanners-directory]
  - AST parser utilities: `lib/utils/ast-parser.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#utils-directory]
  - Type definitions: `lib/types/index.ts` for AST and RepositoryFile types [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#types-directory]
  - Integration with scan action: `lib/actions/scan.ts` [Source: architecture/server-actions-architecture.md#main-scan-function]

- **Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit tests should be placed in `tests/unit/scanners/code-execution.test.ts` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-structure]
  - Use Vitest framework with 80% coverage target for lib files [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach-tooling]
  - Mock filesystem calls for isolated testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-data-mocks]
  - Test eval() detection, threat result formatting, and severity classification [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-test-plan]
  - Test integration with existing code execution scanner capabilities

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - Must integrate with existing CodeExecutionScanner class structure
  - Must maintain compatibility with existing ThreatResult interface
  - Must follow established AST parsing patterns from previous stories
  - Performance impact should be minimal and within time constraints
  - Must handle parse errors gracefully and continue processing other files

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Eval() function usage is classified as CRITICAL severity due to arbitrary code execution risk [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanning-categories]
  - Must detect both obvious and subtle eval() usage patterns
  - Should identify dynamic content in eval() calls as higher risk indicators

## Testing
- **Unit Testing**: 
  - Test eval() function call detection with various patterns
  - Test variable-based eval() call detection
  - Test eval() calls with dynamic content and complex expressions
  - Test threat result formatting and severity classification
  - Test integration with existing code execution scanner
  - Mock AST parsing for isolated testing
  - Achieve 80% code coverage for eval() detection functionality

- **Integration Testing**:
  - Verify integration with main scan action
  - Test end-to-end eval() threat detection workflow
  - Validate threat results are properly categorized and formatted

- **Manual Testing**:
  - Test with sample TypeScript/JavaScript files containing eval() usage
  - Verify threat detection accuracy and result formatting
  - Test with various eval() usage patterns and edge cases
