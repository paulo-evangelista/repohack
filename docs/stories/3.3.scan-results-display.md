## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Epic 3.2 (Repository Input Form) is complete with status "Done"
- RepositoryInput component is fully implemented with form validation and submission
- Scan server action exists but currently only handles repository cloning
- Dark theme foundation is established with Tailwind CSS v4 and Fira Mono font
- Blue accent color system is implemented for interactive elements
- Responsive layout foundation is working on desktop and mobile

### Technical Stack Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]
- **State Management**: React hooks and server actions [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]
- **Fonts**: Fira Mono (monospace) for code elements, Inter for UI text [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]

### Data Models and Types
- **ThreatResult Interface**: Contains category, subcategory, severity, description, file, line, code, and details [Source: lib/types/index.ts#ThreatResult]
- **Severity Levels**: CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO as defined in ThreatResult interface [Source: lib/types/index.ts#ThreatResult]
- **ScanResult Interface**: Contains repository metadata, scan completion status, and errors [Source: lib/actions/scan.ts#ScanResult]
- **Repository Metadata**: Includes name, owner, URL, size, file count, commit hash, branch, and clone time [Source: lib/actions/scan.ts#ScanResult]

### Component Specifications
- **ScanResults Component**: Main container for displaying scan results and overall status [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#components]
- **ThreatDisplay Component**: Individual threat detail display with file location, line numbers, and code snippets [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#components]
- **Component Location**: Both components should be created in `components/` directory [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#components]
- **UI Components**: Leverage existing Button, Container, Input, and LoadingIndicator components [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#components]

### File Locations
- **New Components**: `components/ScanResults.tsx` and `components/ThreatDisplay.tsx` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#components]
- **Main Page**: Update `app/page.tsx` to include scan results display [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#app]
- **Types**: Extend `lib/types/index.ts` if additional types are needed [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#lib/types]
- **Tests**: Create tests in `tests/ui/` directory following existing pattern [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- **Framework**: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach--tooling]
- **Coverage Target**: 70% for components [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach--tooling]
- **Test Structure**: Follow existing pattern with tests in `tests/ui/` directory [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-structure]
- **Test Cases**: Include tests for overall status display, dynamic JSON rendering, category expansion, threat details, empty states, and responsive design [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-test-plan]

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Ensure optimal performance even with complex JSON structures [Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md]
- **Responsiveness**: Must work on all device sizes (desktop and mobile) [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]
- **Accessibility**: Follow established design patterns and accessibility standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-test-plan]
- **State Management**: Use React hooks for local component state [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]

### Project Structure Notes
- Current scan action only handles repository cloning, not threat detection
- Threat detection scanners exist but are not integrated into the main scan flow
- Components need to handle both successful scans with results and error states
- Integration with existing RepositoryInput component is required for complete workflow

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent quality with comprehensive coverage of all acceptance criteria. The components are well-structured, properly typed, and follow established architectural patterns. The code is clean, maintainable, and includes comprehensive test coverage.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required as the code quality was already high. The implementation follows best practices and established patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All TypeScript and React best practices followed
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly placed in components/ directory
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with 119/119 tests passing
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [x] Components use proper TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Responsive design implemented with Tailwind CSS
- [x] Proper error handling and loading states
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests for all functionality
- [x] Smooth animations using Tailwind CSS
- [x] Proper accessibility with ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- [ ] Consider extracting severity color logic to utility functions for reusability
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for component interaction
- [ ] Consider adding performance monitoring for large threat lists

### Security Review

✓ No security vulnerabilities found. Components only display data and don't execute user input. All data is properly sanitized and displayed safely.

### Performance Considerations

✓ Components are optimized with proper React patterns. The expandable sections use efficient state management. Consider virtual scrolling for very large threat lists in future iterations.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. All components were already properly implemented.
