### Data Models and Types
- No specific data models required for this UI foundation story
- Will use standard React component types and Tailwind CSS classes
- Component props will be defined as needed for layout components

### API Specifications
- No API integration required for this story
- Focus is purely on UI foundation and styling
- Will prepare layout structure for future API integration in subsequent stories

### Component Specifications
- **Layout Component**: Main page layout with dark theme and responsive design
- **Container Component**: Wrapper for consistent spacing and max-width
- **Typography Components**: Consistent text styling with Fira Mono for code elements
- **Color System**: Dark theme with blue accent colors for interactive elements

### File Locations and Structure
- **Global Styles**: `app/globals.css` - Update with dark theme variables and Fira Mono font [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#app-directory]
- **Layout Component**: `app/layout.tsx` - Update font configuration and theme setup [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#app-directory]
- **Main Page**: `app/page.tsx` - Replace default template with security scanning layout [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#app-directory]
- **UI Components**: `components/ui/` - Create base UI components for layout [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#components-directory]
- **Tailwind Config**: `tailwind.config.js` - Configure dark theme and custom colors

### Testing Requirements
- **Test File Location**: `tests/ui/` directory for component tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-structure]
- **Test Framework**: React Testing Library for component tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach-tooling]
- **Coverage Target**: 70% for components directory [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach-tooling]
- **Test Patterns**: Render tests, user interaction tests, and accessibility testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-best-practices]

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
- Must maintain Next.js 14+ compatibility
- Must ensure responsive design works on all device sizes
- Must follow accessibility standards for dark theme implementation
- Must integrate with existing project structure and dependencies

### Security Considerations
- No security-specific requirements for this UI foundation story
- Focus is on visual design and user experience
- Will prepare secure form handling structure for future stories

### Performance Considerations
- Font loading should be optimized for Fira Mono
- CSS should be efficiently bundled with Tailwind
- Layout should render quickly without layout shifts
- Responsive design should not impact performance

## Testing
- **Test File Location**: `tests/ui/layout.test.tsx` and `tests/ui/theme.test.tsx`
- **Test Standards**: Use React Testing Library with Vitest framework
- **Testing Frameworks**: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests
- **Specific Testing Requirements**: 
  - Test dark theme application and color scheme
  - Test responsive layout behavior across breakpoints
  - Test font loading and application
  - Test accessibility features (contrast ratios, focus indicators)
  - Test component rendering and styling consistency
