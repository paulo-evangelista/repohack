# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Next.js Foundation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly configured Next.js 14+ project with app directory structure,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the security scanning application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 14+ project is created with app directory structure
2. Project uses TypeScript for type safety
3. Basic project structure includes app/, components/, lib/, and utils/ directories
4. Package.json includes necessary dependencies for development
5. Git repository is initialized with proper .gitignore
6. Project can be run locally with `pnpm dev`
7. Basic health-check route at `/api/health` returns JSON `{ "status": "ok" }`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize Next.js 14+ project with App Router (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript during create process (AC: 2) [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]
  - [ ] Add Tailwind CSS setup (AC: 4) [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]
- [ ] Create base project structure (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add folders and files per structure (AC: 3) [Source: architecture/file-structure.md]
- [ ] Configure package.json and tooling (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add pnpm, ESLint, Prettier configs (AC: 4) [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#development-tools]
- [ ] Initialize git repository (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add appropriate .gitignore (AC: 5)
- [ ] Add health check route `/api/health` (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Implement server action route returning status JSON (AC: 7) [Source: architecture/server-actions-architecture.md#main-scan-function]
- [ ] Verify project runs locally (AC: 6)
  - [ ] `pnpm dev` runs without errors; homepage renders (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
- Technical Stack and expectations:
  - Next.js 14+ with App Router; TypeScript required [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]
  - Tailwind CSS for UI styling [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]
  - Package manager is pnpm; linting with ESLint; formatting with Prettier [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#development-tools]
- File structure to target when scaffolding:
  - See defined structure for `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `lib/actions`, `lib/scanners`, `lib/utils`, and `app/api/health/route.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md]
- Server actions guidance for API routes:
  - Health route should be at `app/api/health/route.ts` returning 200 and status JSON [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#api-health-route-appapihealthroutets]
- Testing guidance (for future stories implementing code):
  - Use Vitest; unit tests live under `tests/**` with the provided structure and coverage targets [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach-tooling]

## Testing
- Manual verification for this story:
  - `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` start server without errors
  - Navigate to `/api/health` and confirm JSON response `{ status: 'ok' }` or equivalent
- Automated tests are not required for scaffolding but must be added when implementing libraries and routes in later stories per testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
