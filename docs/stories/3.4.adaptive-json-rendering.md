# Story 3.4: Adaptive JSON Rendering

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the UI to automatically adapt to any JSON structure the backend provides,
**so that** new threat types can be added without UI changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Subcategories are dynamically rendered as expandable sections
3. Threats array is rendered regardless of threat type or structure
4. New fields added to JSON are automatically displayed
5. UI gracefully handles missing or unexpected JSON fields
6. Component structure is generic and reusable for any data format
7. Performance remains optimal even with complex JSON structures

- **Required Changes**: Make interfaces more flexible to handle dynamic JSON structures
- **New Generic Types**: Need to create generic interfaces for dynamic category and threat rendering

### Component Specifications
- **ScanResults Component**: Currently hardcoded for specific categories, needs to be made fully dynamic [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#components]
- **ThreatDisplay Component**: Currently assumes specific threat structure, needs generic rendering [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#components]
- **Component Location**: Both components in `components/` directory [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#components]

### Technical Constraints
- **Backward Compatibility**: Must work with existing JSON structures while supporting new ones
- **Error Handling**: Must gracefully handle malformed or unexpected JSON data
- **Performance**: Must maintain optimal performance even with complex nested structures
- **Type Safety**: Must maintain TypeScript type safety while supporting dynamic structures
- **Responsiveness**: Must work on all device sizes (desktop and mobile) [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#frontend-technologies]

### Project Structure Notes
- Current components assume specific JSON structure with known categories and threat types
- Need to refactor to support any category structure and threat properties
- Must maintain existing functionality while adding dynamic capabilities
- Integration with existing RepositoryInput component must be preserved
- Error handling and loading states must be maintained
