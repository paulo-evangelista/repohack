# Story 1.2: Repository Cloning Infrastructure

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the system to clone Git repositories from provided URLs,
**so that** I can analyze the code for security threats.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Server action can accept GitHub repository URLs
2. System can clone public repositories using simple-git or similar library
3. Cloned repositories are stored in temporary directory during scanning
4. System handles basic Git operations (clone, checkout, file access)
5. Error handling for invalid URLs, private repositories, and network issues
6. Repository metadata is extracted (name, owner, size, commit hash)
7. Temporary files are properly cleaned up after scanning

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**: 
  - Next.js 15.5.0 project is already configured with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - Health check API route is working at `/api/health`
  - Project structure includes `lib/git/` directory for this functionality [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#git-directory]

- **Technical Stack Requirements**:
  - Use simple-git library for Git operations as specified in technical stack [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#git-operations]
  - Node.js fs module for file operations and temporary directory management [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#backend-technologies]
  - TypeScript for type safety throughout implementation

- **File Locations and Structure**:
  - Main repository functionality: `lib/git/repository.ts` [Source: architecture/file-structure.md#git-directory]
  - Integration with scan action: `lib/actions/scan.ts` [Source: architecture/server-actions-architecture.md#main-scan-function]
  - Types and interfaces: `lib/types/index.ts` for repository-related types

- **API Integration**:
  - Repository cloning will be called from the main scan function in `lib/actions/scan.ts`
  - Function signature: `cloneRepository(repositoryUrl: string): Promise<RepositoryInfo>`
  - Return type should include path, metadata, and cleanup function

- **Error Handling Strategy**:
  - Implement graceful degradation for repository errors [Source: architecture/error-handling-resilience.md#error-categories]
  - Provide user-friendly error messages without technical details [Source: architecture/error-handling-resilience.md#error-handling-strategy]
  - Always attempt cleanup even when errors occur [Source: architecture/error-handling-resilience.md#recovery-mechanisms]

- **Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit tests should be placed in `tests/unit/git/repository.test.ts` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-structure]
  - Use Vitest framework with 80% coverage target for lib files [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach-tooling]
  - Mock simple-git operations and filesystem calls for isolated testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-data-mocks]
  - Test repository cloning, metadata extraction, and cleanup operations [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-test-plan]

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Implement timeout handling for long-running Git operations
  - Use efficient temporary directory management
  - Ensure cleanup happens automatically to prevent disk space issues

## Testing
- **Unit Testing**: 
  - Test repository cloning with valid GitHub URLs
  - Test error handling for invalid URLs, private repos, and network issues
  - Test metadata extraction (name, owner, size, commit hash)
  - Test cleanup operations and temporary file removal
  - Mock simple-git and fs operations for isolated testing
  - Achieve 80% code coverage for `lib/git/repository.ts`

- **Integration Testing**:
  - Verify integration with main scan action
  - Test end-to-end repository scanning workflow
  - Validate cleanup occurs after successful and failed scans

- **Manual Testing**:
  - Test with various GitHub repository URLs (public repos only)
  - Verify temporary files are created and cleaned up
  - Check error messages for invalid URLs and access issues
