  - File system traversal and repository cloning infrastructure is working from previous stories
  - Unit tests are using Vitest framework with 80% coverage target [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#approach-tooling]

- **Technical Stack Requirements**:
  - Use @typescript-eslint/parser for AST generation as specified in technical stack [Source: architecture/technical-stack.md#backend-technologies]

  - ASTNode interface includes type, loc (with line/column), range, and additional properties [Source: lib/types/index.ts]
  - ThreatResult interface requires category, subcategory, severity, description, file, line, code, and details fields [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanner-interface]
  - Scanner interface requires name, category, subcategory, and scan method [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanner-interface]

- **API Specifications**:
  - Code execution scanner must implement ThreatScanner interface with scan method [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanner-interface]
  - Function signature: `scan(files: RepositoryFile[]): Promise<ThreatResult[]>`
  - Scanner must return ThreatResult[] with proper categorization under code_execution category [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanning-categories]
  - Function constructor threats should be categorized as 'code_execution' with 'function_constructor' subcategory

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - Must integrate with existing CodeExecutionScanner class structure
  - Must maintain compatibility with existing ThreatResult interface
  - Must follow established AST parsing patterns from previous stories
  - Performance impact should be minimal and within time constraints
  - Must handle parse errors gracefully and continue processing other files

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Function constructor usage is classified as WARNING severity due to potential code injection risk [Source: architecture/threat-detection-architecture.md#scanning-categories]
  - Must detect both obvious and subtle Function constructor usage patterns
  - Should identify dynamic code strings in Function constructor as higher risk indicators

## Project Structure Notes

- Implementation will enhance existing `lib/scanners/code-execution.ts` file
- Unit tests will be added to existing `tests/unit/scanners/code-execution.test.ts` file
